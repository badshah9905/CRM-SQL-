# 🏢 Case Study Problem Statement
### Company Background
A mid-sized company in the consumer products industry operates across several regions and offers a variety of products. The company has a dedicated sales team and uses a CRM system to manage customer interactions, product sales, and team performance.
Despite having a large customer base and a healthy pipeline of leads, the company has noticed stagnant revenue growth, high customer churn, and inconsistent team performance across regions.
### ❗️Business Problems Identified
### Low Conversion Rate in Sales Pipeline
 The company generates leads but only a small percentage convert to successful deals.
 Management is unsure where in the pipeline the drop-off happens or which product categories perform poorly.
### Unclear Sales Team Performance
 Some sales teams consistently outperform others, but there is no clarity on why.
 The company lacks insight into metrics like deal closing time, win rates, and deal values per team.
### Top Customers Not Identified
 There is no formal segmentation of customers by revenue, industry, or repeat business.
 The company can’t focus its retention or upselling efforts because it doesn't know who its most valuable customers are.
### Revenue Stagnation
 Revenue has plateaued over the last few months despite increased effort and activity.
 Management needs a trend analysis to understand if this is a seasonal issue, a product issue, or something else.
### Product Strategy Misalignment
 Some products sell well, others don’t.
 There is no clarity on which products are driving growth or which are being sold to which segments.
